  Expensive read-after-write consistency: Facebook
uses asynchronous master/slave replication for MySQL,
which poses a problem for caches in data centers using a
replica. Writes are forwarded to the master, but some
time will elapse before they are reflected in the local
replica. Nishtala et al.’s remote markers [21] track keys
that are known to be stale, forwarding reads for those
keys to the master region. By restricting the data model
to objects and associations we can update the replica’s
cache at write time, then use graph semantics to interpret
cache maintenance messages from concurrent updates.
This provides (in the absence of multiple failures) readafter-write consistency for all clients that share a cache,
without requiring inter-regional communication.
